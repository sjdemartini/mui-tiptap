      # TODO(Steven DeMartini): If pre-releases are used in the future (after a
      # non-alpha release has been published), we'll probably want to update
      # this command to pass in `--tag` with next/alpha/beta as appropriate, to
      # avoid updating the default `latest` tag. We could presumably parse the
      # package version using something like
      # `cat package.json | jq -r '.version'`
      # (https://gist.github.com/DarrenN/8c6a5b969481725a4413?permalink_comment_id=4156395#gistcomment-4156395)
      # to parse the version, then could regex for whether it's a pre-release or
      # not.

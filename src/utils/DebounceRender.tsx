 * This component debounces the rendering of its children.
 *
 * WARNING: Use with caution! This component should *only* be used when there
 * are updates triggered via "force-update" (like via Tiptap's `useEditor` hook
 * which updates upon ProseMirror editor changes to the selection, content,
 * etc.). For ordinary React components, traditional memoization techniques
 * around props and state (like useCallback, useMemo, memo, etc.) should be used
 * instead.
 *
 * This component is provided for a very narrow use-case: with our menu
 * controls, without debouncing the controls would re-render per editor state
 * change (e.g. for every character typed or for caret movement), which can bog
 * things down a bit, like when holding down backspace or typing very quickly.
 * (This is due to the way that Tiptap's useEditor re-renders upon changes in
 * the ProseMirror state, which is to force-update
 * https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/blob/b0198eb14b98db5ca691bd9bfe698ffaddbc4ded/packages/react/src/useEditor.ts#L105-L113,
 * rather than in response to prop changes. Because of the force re-render, and
 * since we *do* want to watch editor updates, we have to debounce rendering a
 * bit less conventionally, rather than using callbacks, memo, etc.). We do
 * want/need the menu controls to update very frequently, since we need them to
 * reflect the state of the current cursor position and editor nodes/marks,
 * etc., but we want rendering to stay performant, so the `wait` and `options`
 * defaults below are a reasonable enough balance.

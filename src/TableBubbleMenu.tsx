  // the Popper `open` state changes
  // (https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/5b2583a1c8b227661c4bf4113a79346634ea53af/packages/mui-base/src/PopperUnstyled/PopperUnstyled.tsx#L126-L130).

  // and *not* return an HTML element, since we don't want it to get cached. Otherwise
  // clicking from one table to another will incorrectly get the bubble menu "stuck" on
  // the table that was first used to position the Popper.
